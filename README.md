# Fake-News-Detection-Hindi-English-Using-NLP

# Overview:

This project aims to develop a robust system for detecting fake news and analyzing the sentiment of the identified fake news articles using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model. Fake news has become a significant challenge in the era of information overload, and this project seeks to leverage advanced machine learning models to enhance the accuracy of fake news detection and provide insights into the sentiment associated with the identified fake news.

# Key Features:

# Fake News Detection:

a) Utilize NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze textual data.
b) Implement a BERT-based model for effective and accurate fake news detection.
c) Train the model on a labeled dataset containing both fake and real news articles.

 # Sentiment Analysis:

1) Extend the functionality to perform sentiment analysis on the identified fake news articles.
2) Determine the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, neutral) associated with each piece of fake news.


# Technologies Used:
1) Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilize NLP libraries and techniques for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and analysis.
2) BERT Model: Implement the BERT model, a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, for fake news detection and sentiment analysis.
3) Python: Use Python as the primary programming language for model development, data processing, and implementation.
4) Machine Learning Libraries: Employ popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow or PyTorch for building and training the BERT model.
